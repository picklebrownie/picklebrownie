### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiastic and highly motivated software developer with over five years of diverse experience. My passion for programming and ability to learn quickly on the job makes me an asset to any team. Please contact me at [this.browniedev@gmail.com](mailto:this.browniedev@gmail.com) with any inquiries.

## My Contributions

I recently contributed to an open source project combining PHP 5 or 7, MariaDB, Nginx, phpMyAdmin, Xdebug, and Docker in a VSCode DevContainer. This project was built to help developers manage legacy codebases in a local environment. You can check out the [PHP 5 Starter](https://github.com/visualvoice/php5-mariadb-starter) and the [PHP 7 Starter](https://github.com/visualvoice/php7-mariadb-starter) repositories - I contributed to both codebases and the full wikis on how to set up and use each project.
